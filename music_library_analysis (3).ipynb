    "Pandas' `read_csv()` function allows you to create a DataFrame that contains the data stored inside of a given CSV file. The function has a huge number of options that you can pass in as *keyword arguments* in order to change how the CSV file is interpreted. You can review all of these options in [the Pandas documentation here.](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.read_csv.html) In this case, `read_csv()` should get all of the data successfully with the default options, but the datatypes that it chooses may not always be the best ones. In particular, the `Album Release Date` column will be interpreted as a string by default. This is not \"wrong\", but it will make certain tasks more difficult later on. How you handle this is up to you—the following are three (of several possible) choices for how to handle this typing issue:\n",
    "1. Choose a setting for `read_csv()` that forces Pandas to parse the column as a `datetime` object. (Less code but more documentation reading.)\n",
    "2. Replace the column after reading the CSV by using [`to_datetime()`](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.to_datetime.html). In particular, you should be aware that some dates have Day, Month, and Year whereas some have just the Year. You could almost say that the format is *\"mixed\"...*(Less code but more documentation reading.)\n",
    "3. Keep the column's type as a string and just parse out the year yourself. (Less reading but more code.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Implement the `read_songs()` function. In Checkpoint 1, use the `head()` method to inspect the first few rows of your DataFrame and make sure that it looks OK!"

These columns all store numeric values between `0` and `1` measuring the degree to which each song represents the particular characteristic. For example, a song with a `\"Danceability\"` value of `0.9` would be highly \"danceable\", a song with a `\"Valence\"` of `0.1` will be very sad, and a song with an `\"Instrumentalness\"` score of `0.9` will have very few vocals. \n",

    "Harry likes high energy music; most of his songs range between 0.6 and 1 energy. His songs have medium dancibility, ranging between 0.2 and 0.8. Harry does not like speechiness, instrumental or acoustics, with most of his songs scoring almost 0. Liveness is also skeweed pretty far to the left, with most of his songs scoring between 0.1 and 0.4. Last, Harry clearly does not have a preference for Valence and will listen to songs within any range of valence. "

    "\n",
    "**If you're using a `datetime` object**, then you can extract the year value from a `Series` with the [`dt.year` attribute](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.Series.dt.year.html). The linked documentation has an illuminating example. Once you have each song's year, you can solve the problem in one or two more steps with either filtering or [`.value_counts()`](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.Series.value_counts.html). \n",
    "\n",
    "**If you're using a `str` object**, then you'll have to extract the year by parsing that out of the string. Inspect the column manually and see if you can identify which positions the year occupies in the date strings. (Is it the same for both date formats found in the file?) You can mimic typical Python string slicing (i.e. `s[start:stop:step]`) with the Pandas function [`str.slice()`](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.Series.str.slice.html) function. Once you have a way of isolating the year, the problem can be solved with filtering or `.value_counts()`."

It's possible to get a sense of what a genre is supposed to refer to by listening to songs tagged with it, but it's also useful to understand the genres in the context of the timeframe from which its constituent songs come. Furthermore, many genres of music evolve significantly over time—compare Future to Run-DMC or Johnny Cash to Florida Georgia Line, for example. \n",

(You can make it look nicer if you like—coloring the bars by release year could be a lot of fun!)

    "The main hypothesis that drives the model we have built is that the songs that I have saved to my library might tend to fit a certain profile. Maybe my taste is, for example, happy, high-energy, acoustic-sounding music. In order to prove that, it will be important to have examples of songs that are not currently among my Liked Songs. \n",

    "These come from an anonymous friend—let's call her \"E\"—and are found in the file called `other_songs.csv`. By introducing songs that come from another library—from another person with a different taste for music—we might introduce some examples that have notably different musical profiles. This will give our model a notion of what music outside of my personal taste might look like so that it can learn to identify examples of it. Then, the model will be tasked with estimating the probability that a song with a certain profile comes from my library instead of E's library.\n",
    "\n",
    "The model is actually built using the steps outlined in the included `building_a_model.ipynb`. You do not have to read anything or run any code found in that notebook, but it does show you how the model is built if you're curious. We can load the model using the following cell:"

    "I believe the prediction is reliable when given proper context. Rather than serving the purpose to determine whose song is whose, I think the predic() funciton would work well to see if a certain song matches your music \"taste\" based on provided data. The more songs given (ie. more data) makes any calculation/prediction more reliable. I believe given the sharry_songs.csv, we do have enough data to make an accurate prediction about Harry's music taste (considering the fact that there is so much data that not even Codio can process and display it). To get a good sense of the model's accuracy would be to test it with some of Harry's favorite/most listened to songs. If the model is accurate, the songs shoud recieve a high score; otherwise would indicate some sort of flaw in the model."

Rather than relying on only Harry's data to make a claim about two people, two pieces of data should be provided to make a more accurate analysis. This could result in a more accurate representation of songs that may be \"outliers\" in Harry's data by representing it as some sort of middle value, rather automatically assigning it to the other person, when this could very much not be the case.
